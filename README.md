#### [tmlr](https://github.com/trackmania-rl/tmrl) - "a fully-fledged distributed RL framework for robotics, designed to help you train Deep Reinforcement Learning AIs in real-time applications"
- This is a pretty cool framework which was originally made for playing Trackmania. He has some nice videos demonstrating it being put to use.
- While Trackmania would be a cool game for us to work on, I think it could be a little out of our depth.
- Still, there are some instructions for using this framework on other games.

#### https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro - "A fork of gym-retro ('lets you turn classic video games into Gymnasium environments for reinforcement learning') with additional games, emulators and supported platforms."
- Seems pretty interesting and useful for establishing games on the reinforcement learning side of things
- Could choose a semi-difficult, interesting one from here.

#### https://github.com/amjadmajid/deep-reinforcement-learning-games-from-scratch - Deep Reinforcement Learning: Building Games from Scratch
- This one is quite cool but the games are very basic (snake, gridsearch etc)
- However, was all built without the use of gymnasium's library
- Could provide a better underlying understanding of reinforcement learning and make for a better project.
